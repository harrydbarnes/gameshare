                        <li>If it says "Disable", it's already enabled for another account. Only one account per PS5 can enable this.</li>
                        <li>If it says "Don't Disable", <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s account has this enabled on another PS5. Disable it there first.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h2>Key Points & Risks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trust is Crucial:</strong> <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> logs into their account on <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s PS5. Share only with trusted individuals. Use 2-Step Verification on <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s account.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary PS5:</strong> <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> makes <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s PS5 their primary console for "Console Sharing and Offline Play." This means <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> needs internet to play their own digital games on their own PS5.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Games Only:</strong> Does not work for disc games.</li>
                <li><strong>Account Safety:</strong> Account sharing is against PSN Terms of Service. Risk is low but not zero.</li>
                <li><strong>DLC Shared:</strong> DLC and add-ons are usually shared.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>After Setup</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> (Owner):</strong> Needs internet to play their digital games on their own PS5.</li>
                <li><strong><span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> (Receiver):</strong> Can play shared games offline on their PS5.</li>
                <li><strong>Playing Together:</strong> Both can play online (different games or same shared game) on their own accounts.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't Share <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s Account Login:</strong> <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> plays on their *own* account.</li>
                <li><strong>Changing Primary:</strong> If <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> enables "Console Sharing" on a different PS5, <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> loses access.</li>
                <li><strong>PS Plus:</strong> If <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> has PS Plus, <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> can play <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s games online and access their PS Plus monthly games.</li>
