            <h2>Instructions for <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> (Game Owner)</h2>
            <p>These are the steps <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> (the person who owns the games) needs to follow. <strong>Crucially, these steps are performed on <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s PS5 console.</strong> <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> will need their PSN login credentials.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>On <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s PS5, go to <strong>Settings</strong> (the gear icon in the top right).</li>
                <li>Select <strong>Users and Accounts</strong>.</li>
                <li>Select <strong>Other</strong>.</li>
                <li>Select <strong>Console Sharing and Offline Play</strong>.</li>
                <li>If it says "Disable" for this PS5, it means it's already enabled, likely for another account on <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s console. If <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> is already game sharing with someone else, or if their own account has this enabled, <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> cannot enable it for their account simultaneously on this console. One PS5 can only have "Console Sharing and Offline Play" enabled for *one* account at a time. Assuming it's not enabled, or <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> is okay with disabling it for their own account (or another account), proceed.</li>
                <li>Select <strong>Enable</strong>. If it says "Don't Disable", then <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s account is already set as the primary on a *different* PS5. <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> can only have one PS5 designated for "Console Sharing and Offline Play". If <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> wants to proceed, they would need to disable it on their other PS5 first.</li>
                <li>Once "Console Sharing and Offline Play" is <strong>Enabled</strong> for <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s account on <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s PS5, <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> should log out of their account on <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s PS5. (Go to Settings > Users and Accounts > Other > Sign Out). It's good practice for security.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Summary for <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>:</strong> Log into your PSN account on <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s PS5, enable "Console Sharing and Offline Play" for your account on that console, then log out.</p>

            <h2>Instructions for <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> (Game Receiver)</h2>
            <p>After <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> has completed the steps above on <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s PS5, <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> can now access <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s games.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> is logged into their own PSN account on their PS5.</li>
                <li>Go to the <strong>Game Library</strong> (usually at the far right of the games row on the home screen).</li>
                <li>In the Game Library, navigate to the "Your Collection" tab. <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> should now see all of <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s digital PS5 and PS4 games listed alongside their own.</li>
                <li><span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> can download and play any of <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s games.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Summary for <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>:</strong> Simply log into your own account on your PS5, and <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s games will appear in your library, ready to download and play.</p>

            <h2>Important Considerations & Risks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trust is Essential:</strong> <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> is giving <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> access to their entire library of games. More importantly, to enable this, <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> has to log into their PSN account on <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s console. Only do this with someone you trust implicitly. <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> should ideally log out of their account on <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s console after setup, but their account details will have been entered. Consider enabling 2-Step Verification on <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s account for added security.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Console Designation:</strong> <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s account can only have "Console Sharing and Offline Play" enabled on ONE PS5 console at a time. By enabling it on <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s PS5, <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s own PS5 (if they have one) is no longer their primary console for that account. This has implications for <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> (see below).</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Games Only:</strong> Game sharing only works for digital games purchased from the PlayStation Store. It does not work for disc-based games.</li>
                <li><strong>Account Bans (Low Risk but Possible):</strong> While generally accepted, sharing account details is technically against PlayStation's Terms of Service. The risk of an account ban is low, especially for sharing between close friends or family, but it's not zero.</li>
                <li><strong>DLC and Add-ons:</strong> DLC and add-ons purchased by <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> are generally shared along with the base game.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="post-setup">
            <h2>Post-Setup Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s Offline Play:</strong> Since <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s PS5 is no longer their primary console (because <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s PS5 is now designated for "Console Sharing and Offline Play" for <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s account), <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> <strong>must be connected to the internet</strong> on their own PS5 to play their own digital games. If their internet goes down, they will lose access to their digital titles until the connection is restored. This is the main trade-off for <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>.</li>
                <li><strong><span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s Offline Play:</strong> <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> can play <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s shared digital games on their PS5 (where "Console Sharing and Offline Play" is enabled for <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s account) <strong>offline without any issues</strong>. They can also play their own digital games offline.</li>
                <li><strong>Simultaneous Online Play (Different Accounts, Different Games):</strong> Yes. <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> can be signed into their account on their PS5 playing Game A, and <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> can be signed into their own account on their PS5 playing Game B (one of <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s shared games or their own).</li>
                <li><strong>Simultaneous Online Play (Different Accounts, Same Shared Game):</strong> Generally, yes. <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> can play a game they own, and <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> can play that same game via game sharing simultaneously, as long as they are on their respective accounts. Some games might have specific restrictions, but it usually works.</li>
                <li><strong>Can both players be signed into <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s account at the same time on different consoles?</strong> No. If <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> signs into their account on their PS5 while <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> (or anyone) is signed into <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s account on <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s PS5, the person who was signed in first will usually be kicked out. For game sharing to work as intended, <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> plays on THEIR OWN account.</li>
                <li><strong>What if <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> changes their Primary PS5 activation?</strong> If <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> later disables "Console Sharing and Offline Play" on <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s PS5 (e.g., by enabling it on their own PS5 again or a new PS5), <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> will immediately lose access to <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s shared games. The games will appear with a lock icon.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintaining Access:</strong> For <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> to maintain access, <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s account must keep "Console Sharing and Offline Play" enabled on <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s PS5.</li>
                <li><strong>Subscription Services (PlayStation Plus):</strong> Benefits like online multiplayer access from PS Plus are tied to the account that has the subscription. If <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> has PS Plus, <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> (on the console where <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> has "Console Sharing and Offline Play" enabled) can play <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s games online using <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span>'s own account. Monthly PS Plus games claimed by <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span> will also be available to <span class="player2-name">Player 2</span> as long as <span class="player1-name">Player 1</span>'s PS Plus subscription is active and game sharing is set up.</li>
